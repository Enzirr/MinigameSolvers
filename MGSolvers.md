Mini-Game Solvers

BlockSolver - WIP

Solver for a game, where goal is to fit a set of blocks into a space. Game space is in format of uniform integer grid.
Method: Backtracking/Space Search

Input text file format:
x y
[x times y numbers; 0 for free space -1 for blocked]
#n-of-blocks
[x y dimensions of block
x times y numbers; 0 for block body, -1 otherwise]

Program is a bit older, I'm not entirely sure about the input file or intended usage.
